#Data is right skewed.

#2(b)
#Plotting a scatter plot to show the relationship between hrs extracurricular and GPA 
plot(cleanedSurvey$GPA,cleanedSurvey$hrs_extracurricular)
#The scatter plot showed that there may be a slight positive correlation. Higher GPAs have more extracurricular involvement.

#Finding correation between hrs extracurricular and GPA 
cor(cleanedSurvey$GPA,cleanedSurvey$hrs_extracurricular) 
cor.test(cleanedSurvey$GPA,cleanedSurvey$hrs_extracurricular) 
#The correlation is 0.1459643. This is a weak positive correlation. 
#The 95% confidence interval is (0.007372618, 0.279054151) and does not include 
#zero, which means the null hypothesis (p=0) is rejected.

#3(b)
#Get confidence interval for intercept and slope 
confint(model1) 
#The confidence interval for the intercept is (-10.8649885, 7.281313) 
#The intercept is not significantly different than zero since the p-value > 0.05 also since the confidence interval includes 0

#3(c)
#Get confidence interval for intercept and slope. 
confint(model1) 
#The confidence interval for the slope is (0.1386326, 5.390075). 
#Since it does not include 0 we can conclude the slope is significantly different (greater than) 0

#3(d)
#The R 2 of the model is 0.02131. 
#This is quite low and so the association between hrs extrscurricula and GPA is rickety.

#3(e)
#The residual standard error is 7.303 on 198 degrees of freedom. It is moderately high.
