#Tobit Models

#Examples of Tobit Analysis
#Example 1.  In the 1980s there was a federal law restricting speedometer readings to no more than 85 mph. 
#            So if you wanted to try and predict a vehicle's top-speed from a combination of horse-power 
#            and engine size, you would get a reading no higher than 85, regardless of how fast the vehicle was 
#            really traveling. This is a classic case of right-censoring (censoring from above) of the data. 
#            The only thing we are certain of is that those vehicles were traveling at least 85 mph.

#Example 2.  A research project is studying the level of lead in home drinking water 
#            as a function of the age of a house and family income. 
#            The water testing kit cannot detect lead concentrations below 5 parts per billion (ppb). 
#            The EPA considers levels above 15 ppb to be dangerous. 
#            These data are an example of left-censoring (censoring from below).

#Example 3.  Consider the situation in which we have a measure of academic aptitude (scaled 200-800) 
#            which we want to model using reading and math test scores, as well as, the type of program the 
#            student is enrolled in (academic, general, or vocational). 
#            The problem here is that students who answer all questions on the academic aptitude test correctly 
#            receive a score of 800, even though it is likely that these students are not "truly" equal in aptitude. 
#            The same is true of students who answer all of the questions incorrectly. 
#            All such students would have a score of 200, although they may not all be of equal aptitude.
