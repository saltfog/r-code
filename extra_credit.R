#1. What is the estimated linear regression equation? Å· = 3.47 - 0.188908(Emory_FirstChoiceYes) + 0.006911(hrs_extracurricular) 
#2. The intercept is 3.47 - at 0 hours of extracurriculars and 0 Emory_FirstChoiceYes the GPA is 3.47. The confidence interval is (3.3776318612, 3.56271670) which means it is very different from 0. 
#3  The slope is -0.188908 an the confidence interval is (-0.0002181709, 0.01403948) 
#4  The slope is 0.006911 and the confidence interval is (-0.2937626424, -0.08405350) 
#5  Yes.
